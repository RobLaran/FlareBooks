                <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                <p>At FlareBooks, our goal is to make library management simple and efficient. We aim to help schools,
                    small libraries, and book enthusiasts easily manage their collections using a clean and
                    user-friendly system.</p>

                <p>Developed in 2025, FlareBooks was created as a lightweight and practical system for managing books
                    and users. It focuses on providing essential features like book tracking, user management, and a
                    dashboard overview — without unnecessary complexity.</p>

                <p>We believe that technology doesn’t have to be complicated to be effective. FlareBooks is built to be
                    simple, reliable, and easy to use — helping users organize their libraries with confidence and
                    clarity.</p>
